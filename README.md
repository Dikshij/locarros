# Locarros

A simple Ruby on Rails project to manage cars in a corporate parking spot. With
Locarros, employees can register, change and delete their cars and motorcycles
on a web interface, so security staff can know which car belongs to whom.

Admins, on the other hand, can see reports of how many people are using the
parking lot and the amount of cars and motorcycles on the database.

The software came from the need of such a system inside
[Locaweb](http://www.locaweb.com.br), a Brazilian hosting company and made as an
exercise on Rails training.

The name _Locarros_ is the derived from _Locaweb_ and _Carros_, which is the
Portuguese word for _cars_.
